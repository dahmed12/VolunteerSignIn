Volunteer signin and log sheet
This Volunteer Sign-in and log application is a simple solution to an annoying problem on campus. It helps students to login to events for
which they have volunteered and track the hours they have done and hours remaining.
Each student has a maximum of 30hrs to complete per semester. At the end of the semester, students and volunteer coordinators should be able to view hours completed, as well as where and when those hours were done.
